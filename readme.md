# Breast Cancer Diagnostic Model

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model for diagnosing breast cancer using a dataset of various diagnostic features. The project utilizes different machine learning techniques to build and evaluate models, aiming to assist in accurate and early diagnosis of breast cancer.

## Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model based on features extracted from breast cancer diagnostic images.

The dataset used in this project includes features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension, among others. The target variable is the diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign).

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the following packages installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
